## 02 - Prediction_of_house_price


The data set contains house sale price for King County, Seattle. It includes homes between May 2014 and May 2015.

The original data comes from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-wwwcourseraorg-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMDeveloperSkillsNetworkDA0101ENSkillsNetwork20235326-2022-01-01

This project is conducted based on the Coursera course - Data analysis with Python by IBM.

**Conclusions**

1. Three predicting technique: Polynomial Regression model, Ridge Regression model and Random forest model, are studied and compored. 

2. From the analysis, it was found that the Random Forest Regression model performed better than the Ridge Regression model and Polynomial Regression model.

3. By using the Folium lib, the location of the house corresponding to the price is ploted. And it was found that location is a very important factor in determining the price of the house.
